* Review the Pigeonhole Principle

## The Pidegonhole Principle

<p align="center"><img src="fig/pigeonhole.jpg"/></p>

A **pigeonhole** was used to describe both a small recess where a bird may be kept, as well as one of many compartments in a messagebox where one can stick a note for another party to retrieve.
Today, most of the time we talk about pigeonholes, we are thinking of a particular idea called the **pigeonhole principle**.

**Pigeonhole Principle:**  If I have $$n+1$$ pigeons that I need to place in $$n$$ pigeonholes, some poor birds are going to have to double up.

Functionally, we can say this a very abstract way.

**Theorem:** Suppose that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are finite set and $$A$$ has more elements than $$B$$.  Then it is impossible to construct an injective function $$f: A\rightarrow B$$.

There are many generalizations of the Pigeonhole Principle, such as the following

**Theorem:**  If $$n$$ people together hold more than $$kn$$ dollars, than at least one of the people must have more than $$k$$ dollars.


## Examples of Applications

The Pigeonhole Principle is simple, intuitive, and powerful.  Let's explore some examples demonstrating this.

**Problem:**  Let $$S$$ be a set of $$n$$ integers.  Prove there must exist a nonempty subset $$A\subseteq S$$ satisfying the property that the sum of all the elements of $$A$$ is divisible by $$N$$.

**Solution:**

Proof:

Let $$S = \{a_1,\dots, a_n\}$$ and $$s_m = \sum_{k=1}^m a_k$$.
Then $$s_1,\dots,s_n$$ are $$n$$ different values.
If any of the $$s_k$$ are divisible by $$n$$, we are done.
Assume otherwise.
Then the value of $$s_k$$ modulo $$n$$ must belong to the set $$\{1,\dots, n-1\}$$.
By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists $$1\leq i < j\leq n$$ with $$s_i=s_j\mod n$$.
Consequently  $$\sum_{k=i+1}^j a_k$$ is divisible by $$n$$.
Thus $$A = \{a_{i+1},\dots, a_{j}\}$$ has the desired property.

**Problem:**  Show that if $$a,b,c$$ are integers, then $$(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)$$ must be even.

**Solution:**

At least two of the numbers have to have the same parity.

**Problem:**  Show that if $$x_0,\dots, x_n$$ are integers then $$\frac{1}{n!}\prod_{0\leq i < j\leq n} (x_i-x_j)$$ is also an integer.

**Solution:**

This is true for $$n=1$$, since everything is divisible by $$1$$.
As an inductive assumption, suppose that it is true for $$n=m$$.
Then if we have some integers $$x_0,\dots, x_{m+1}$$, the Pigeonhole Principle says two of the values $$x_0,\dots, x_{m+1}$$ must have the same value modulo $$m+1$$.
Therefore there exists $$0\leq i < j\leq n$$ with $$x_i-x_j$$ divisible by $$m+1$$.
Now applying our inductive assumption to $$\{x_0,\dots, x_{m+1}\}\backslash\{x_j\}$$, we see that the product is divisible by $$m!(m+1) = (m+1)!$$.
Thus by the Principle of Induction, the statement holds for all $$n\geq 1$$.

## Problems

**Problem:** Consider the set $$S = \{1,2,\dots, 2n\}$$.  Show that any subset $$A\subseteq S$$ consisting of $$n+1$$ elements must have two elements wherein one divides the other.

**Problem:** Determine how many rooks can be placed on a chessboard such that no two rooks can collide with one another.

**Problem:** Determine how many bishops can be placed on a chessboard such that no two bishops can collide with one another.

**Problem:** Determine how many queens can be placed on a chessboard such that no two queens can collide with one another.

**Problem:** Show that if we have a group of $$n$$ people, there must be two people with the same number of friends in the group.

**Problem:** Every point in a plane is either red, green or blue.  Show that there exists a rectangle in the plane whose vertices are all the same color.

**Problem:** Suppose that five points are chosen on a square with side length one.  Prove that at least two of the points must be within $$\sqrt{2}/2$$ of one another.

**Problem:** Suppose the Problem Solving Seminar has at least 10 people attending today between the ages of $$1$$ and $$60$$.  Prove that we can find two disjoint subsets of people where the sum of the ages of the members of each set is the same.
