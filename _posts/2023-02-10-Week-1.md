## Digits of perfect squares

Lots of great mathematics can come from asking very basic questions.
Today, we will look at one such example, as we explore the following, childish-sounding line of thought.

Recall that a **perfect square** is a positive integer, whose square root is also an integer.

**Question:** What can the last few digits of a perfect square be?

On the surface, this looks kind of simple.
You might be tempted to say, well they can be anything!
But we will immediately realize this is not the case, if we explore what the last digit ends up being.

**Problem:** Determine what the last digit a perfect square can be.

**Solution:**

If the last digit of $$n$$ is $$a$$, then the last digit of $$n^2$$ is the same as the last digit of $$a^2$$.
Thus we only need to consider the squares of single-digit integers.

|$$a$$| last digit of $$a^2$$ |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 0 |  0 |
| 1 |  1 | 
| 2 |  4 | 
| 3 |  9 | 
| 4 |  6 | 
| 5 |  5 | 
| 6 |  6 | 
| 7 |  9 |
| 8 |  4 | 
| 9 |  1 |

We see that the last digit can only be $$1, 4, 5, 6,$$ or $$9$$.


More generally, we could ask ourselves about what the last *two* digits of a perfect square can be.

**Problem:** Determine what the last digit a perfect square can be.

**Solution:**

If the last two digits of $$n$$ are $$b$$ and $$a$$, so that $$n = \dots ba$$, then the last two digits of $$n^2$$ are the same as the last two digits of $$(ba)^2$$.
To figure out the possibilities, we can make a table of values whose rows represent the value of $$a$$ and whose columns indicate the value of $$b$$, the entries of which are the last two digits.

|       | b=0 | b=1 | b=2 | b=3 | b=4 | b=5 | b=6 | b=7 | b=8 | b=9 |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a = 0 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 |
| a = 1 | 01 | 21 | 41 | 61 | 81 | 01 | 21 | 41 | 61 | 81 |
| a = 2 | 04 | 44 | 84 | 24 | 64 | 04 | 44 | 84 | 24 | 64 |
| a = 3 | 09 | 69 | 29 | 89 | 49 | 09 | 69 | 29 | 89 | 49 |
| a = 4 | 16 | 96 | 76 | 56 | 36 | 16 | 96 | 76 | 56 | 36 |
| a = 5 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 |
| a = 6 | 36 | 56 | 76 | 96 | 16 | 36 | 56 | 76 | 96 | 16 |
| a = 7 | 49 | 89 | 29 | 69 | 09 | 49 | 89 | 29 | 69 | 09 |
| a = 8 | 64 | 24 | 84 | 44 | 04 | 64 | 24 | 84 | 44 | 04 |
| a = 9 | 81 | 61 | 41 | 21 | 01 | 81 | 61 | 41 | 21 | 01 |
