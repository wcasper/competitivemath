title: Competitive Mathematics
---

**Organizer:** Dr. W. Riley Casper [(About your instructor)](instructor)

**Email:** wcasper@fullerton.edu

**Weekly meetings:** Friday 1:00PM-2:00PM in MH 476

This site is meant to serve as an informal course in **competitive mathematics**, by which we mean techniques, ideas, and tricks applicable to mathematical competitions at the college level.
The methods found herein will often be more broadly applicable to mathematics outside of competitions 
In a certain sense, anything found here is something mathematicians *should know*, so even if one doesn't intend to ever participate in a math competition, the material presented here can still play useful role in the process of broader mathematical maturation.
